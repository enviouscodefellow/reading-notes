#### Version Control

Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectified.

#### Local Version Control

Many years ago, programmers created Local Version Control systems. A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.

#### Centralized Version Control

The need for collaboration within a developer team on a single file or set of files led to the advent of the Centralized Version Control System (CVCS). This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients. This streamlined the collaboration process (by eliminating the need to involve all local databases), allowed programmers to have more knowledge of team members’ activities with certain files, and gave administrators much more control over divvying up revision privileges.

#### Distributed Version Control

A Distributed Version Control systems (DVCS) addresses the major vulnerability of the CVS: the server as a single point of failure. If a CVS goes down, collaborators cannot work with each other on a file or save changes and new versions. Also, in the event of corruption of a central database’s hard disk — with the absence of backups — all work will be lost, except for any portions on local machines.

To prevent this type of catastrophic loss, a DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.

Because the DVCS allows for multiple mirrored repositories, programmers working in teams can collaborate with each other in various ways to complete a joint project, which enables the use of various simultaneous workflows.

#### So, what is Git?

#### Snapshots

Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.

#### Local Operations

Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources. This allows for process expediency because a project’s history resides on the local disk, eliminating the need to fetch history information from the server, and allowing one to continue work on a project even when not online or on a VPN.

#### Tracking Changes

Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git. And, as the gatekeeper, Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.

#### Loss of Data

Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data. Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.

#### States

Files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged.

##### Committed

Data is securely stored in a local database

##### Modified

File has been changed but not committed to the database

##### Staged

Flagged a file’s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot

History of Git
Git traces its roots to the open source software project Linux kernel. Developers of this project began using a DVCS called BitKeeper in 2002. In 2005, many of these developers stopped using this DVCS due to tension between the Linux kernel community and the company behind BitKeeper’s and the eventual revocation of the DVCS’ gratis status. Subsequently, Linus Torvalds, the chief architect of the Linux kernel, began creating Git. With the intention of creating a DVCS with a workflow design similar to that of BitKeeper, which was also fast, Git allowed for non-linear development via multiple branches, could support large projects, possessed strong mechanisms preventing corruption, and had a simple design. Since its inception in 2005, Git has become one of the most utilized Version Control Systems in the world.
