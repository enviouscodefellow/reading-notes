[Local Storage and How To Use It On Websites](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/10/local-storage-and-how-to-use-it/)

#### Why would a developer use local storage for a web application?
* when you use an application and then close it, its state will be reset the next time you open it. If you close an application on your desktop and re-open it, its most recent state is restored
* So...as a developer, you need to store the state of your interface somewhere. 
* This is where local storage comes in. You would keep a key on the user’s computer and read it out when the user returns.

#### What information should not be stored in local storage?
* PII or passwords

#### Local storage can store what type of data? How would you convert it to that type before storing?
* only store strings in the different keys. This means that when you have an object, it will not be stored the right way.
