## Things I want to know more about

* Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem.
* Every recursive function has two parts: the base case, where the function stops calling itself and returns a value, and the recursive case, where the function calls itself to solve a smaller version of the same problem.
* Recursion can be used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller sub-problems of the same type.
* It can simplify the code and make it more readable.
* However, it can also cause stack overflow if the base case is not well defined or reached, or if the recursion goes on in
* definitely.
