## Things I want to know more about

+ Encryption is the process of converting plaintext into a form that is unreadable without a secret key.
* Decryption is the process of converting the encrypted data back into its original form using the secret key.
* Symmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption.
* Asymmetric encryption uses a public key to encrypt the data and a private key to decrypt the data.
* Code cracking refers to the process of figuring out the encryption key or algorithm used to encrypt a message, without access to the key.
