#### Reading
[How to Run Linear Regression in Python](https://www.activestate.com/resources/quick-reads/how-to-run-linear-regressions-in-python-scikit-learn/)

NOTE: The content to read ends at the Regression vs Classification section. After that itâ€™s a product pitch for ActiveState which is not required, though you may find it interesting.

[What is Linear Regression](https://www.statisticssolutions.com/what-is-linear-regression/)

## Things I want to know more about

* Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
* It is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm.
* It assumes that the relationship between the variables is linear.
* The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line through the data points.
* The line is represented by an equation of the form Y = a + bX, where X is the independent variable and Y is the dependent variable. a and b are the parameters of the model, also called the coefficients, which are estimated from the data.
