## Things I want to know more about

* Classes are a way to define custom data types in Python.
* Classes define the structure and behavior of objects, which are instances of the class.
* Each class can have its own methods, which are functions that operate on the data of the class.
* Classes also have attributes, which are variables that hold data associated with the class.
* Classes can also have a constructor (__init__ method) that gets called when a new object is created, and a destructor (__del__ method) that gets called when an object is deleted.
