## Things I want to know more about

* React Context is a way to share data between components without passing props manually at every level.
* React Context is created using the React.createContext method and then consumed in components using the useContext hook.
* React Context provides a way to centralize data management in an application, making it easier to share state between components.
* The React.createContext method takes an optional default value as its argument, which can be used to set the default value for the context.
* The useContext hook takes a context object as its argument and returns the current value of the context.
* Components that need access to context data should be wrapped in a Context.Provider component, which takes a value prop to set the value of the context.
* The Context.Provider component should be placed higher in the component tree so that it can be used by components lower down in the tree.
* React Context is a powerful tool for managing state in React applications and should be used with caution, as it can make the code difficult to understand if used improperly.
