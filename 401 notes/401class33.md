## Things I want to know more about

* JWT stands for JSON Web Token, a compact and self-contained means of transmitting information.
* JWT consists of three parts: header, payload, and signature.
* The header specifies the type of token and the signing algorithm used.
* The payload contains claims, which are statements about an entity (e.g. user) and its properties.
* The signature is used to verify the authenticity of the token and ensure it has not been tampered with.
* JWT can be used for authentication, information exchange, and creating access tokens.
* JWT is widely supported by various programming languages and frameworks, and can be used in a variety of applications.
* JWT is stateless, meaning it doesn't require the server to store information about the token.
