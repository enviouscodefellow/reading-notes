## Things I want to know more about

* The article is about GitHub, a platform where millions of open source projects are hosted and shared.
* Open source software is free to use and explore, and anyone can contribute to improve it.
* GitHub helps developers collaborate, review code, track bugs, manage workflows, and secure code.
* GitHub also supports open source communities with features like GitHub Sponsors, GitHub Actions, GitHub Pages, and more.
* GitHub is not open source itself, meaning its source code is not publicly available or licensed.
* GitHub's source code is encrypted and hosted on its own servers.
* Some developers prefer open source alternatives to GitHub, such as GitLab, Gitea, SourceHut, etc.
* GitHub is owned by Microsoft since 2018, but operates independently
