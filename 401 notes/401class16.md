## Things I want to know more about

* Serverless computing is a way to run code without having to manage servers.
* Instead of having to provision and manage servers, serverless computing allows you to run your code in response to specific events, such as an HTTP request or a file upload.
* This can help you save on costs and increase scalability.
* IBM Cloud offers a serverless platform called IBM Cloud Functions, which allows you to run your code in response to various events, such as changes in a database, file uploads, and more.
* IBM Cloud also offers other serverless services such as IBM Cloud Object Storage, IBM Cloud Databases and IBM Cloudant.
