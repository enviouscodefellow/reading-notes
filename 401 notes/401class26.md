## Things I want to know more about

* Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables the rapid development of secure and maintainable websites.

* It follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern, which separates the data model, the user interface, and the control flow of an application.

* Django provides an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system that maps Python objects to database tables, allowing developers to interact with databases using Python code rather than SQL.

* It also includes an administrative interface that allows developers to manage the data of their application through a web-based interface.

* Django's built-in security features include protection against cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and SQL injection attacks.

* The framework also provides support for user authentication and authorization, as well as handling form input and file uploads.

* Django can be used to develop a wide range of web applications, including content management systems, social networks, and e-commerce platforms.

* It is widely used in industry, with notable examples of companies using Django including Instagram, Pinterest, and Mozilla.
