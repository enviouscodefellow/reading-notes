## Things I want to know more about

* Django's built-in User model can be customized to better fit the needs of a project
* A custom user model can be defined by creating a new model that inherits from AbstractBaseUser
* Additional fields can be added to the custom user model
* A manager class, which handles database operations for the custom user model, must also be defined
* The custom user model must be specified in the project's settings file
* The custom user model will be used instead of Django's built-in User model
* The custom user model can also be used in conjunction with Django's built-in PermissionsMixin for user permissions
* Customizing the user model can make it easier to add new fields, change authentication methods, and improve the overall flexibility of the user authentication system.
