## Things I want to know more about

* List comprehensions are a concise way to create a list in Python.
* They are a combination of a loop and an expression, used to generate a new list based on an existing list or other iterable.
* They have the form of [expression for item in iterable] or [expression for item in iterable if condition]
* List comprehensions can be used to perform a simple operation on each item of an iterable, such as a list, tuple or a string.
* They are also faster and more memory efficient than equivalent for loop and filter function constructs
* List comprehensions can also be nested to create a more complex list.
