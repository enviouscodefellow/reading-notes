We won’t be covering this concept in depth until following class but it’s a big concept and needs some time to settle in.

## Things I want to know more about

* The random module in Python provides functions to generate pseudo-random numbers.
* The randint() function generates a random integer within a specified range.
* The uniform() function generates a random floating-point number within a specified range.
* The shuffle() function can be used to randomly shuffle the items in a list.
* The choice() function can be used to randomly select an item from a list.
