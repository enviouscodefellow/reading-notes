## Things I want to know more about

* Regular expressions are a way to search for patterns in strings using special syntax.
* Python's re module provides functions for working with regular expressions.
* The search() function is used to search for a pattern in a string, and returns a match object if a match is found.
* The findall() function returns a list of all matches in the string.
* The sub() function can be used to replace matches with a different string.
