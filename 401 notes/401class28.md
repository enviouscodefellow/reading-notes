## Things I want to know more about

* A form is a way to collect data from the user and send it to the server.
* In Django, forms are created by inheriting from the forms.Form class or the forms.ModelForm class.
* The forms.Form class allows you to define the fields of the form and their validation rules.
* The forms.ModelForm class is used when the form is based on a model, it will automatically generate the form fields based on the model's fields.
* Forms can be rendered in templates using the form.as_p, form.as_table, and form.as_ul methods.
* Form data is sent to the server using the HTTP POST method.
* In the view, the form data is accessed using the request.POST or request.GET attribute, depending on the method used in the form.
* Form data is validated using the is_valid() method, and errors can be accessed using the errors attribute.
