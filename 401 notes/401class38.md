## Things I want to know more about

* Breaking the UI into components: Divide the UI into components based on the responsibilities they have.
* Decide on the state: Identify what data the application should manage and what should be props.
* Identify the relationships between components: Determine how the components interact with each other and how they share data.
* Determine the flow of data: Decide how data should flow between components, both up (from child to parent) and down (from parent to child).
* Building a static version: Start by building a static version of the UI with no interactivity, just to make sure everything is correctly structured.
* Identifying where the state should live: Determine the “single source of truth” for the state.
* Add interactivity: Add interactivity by setting the state in response to events.
* Test the application: Test the entire application from top to bottom to make sure everything is working correctly.
