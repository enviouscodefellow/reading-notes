#### Reading
NOTE This is a long reading. The portion to make sure you cover is on global and nonlocal keywords. You can skim the rest.

#### Videos
NOTE* The repeated Big O content is intentional. This is a big concept and worth hearing about from multiple presenters. TIP: watch on faster speed if you like.

## Things I want to know more about

* Variables in Python have a scope, which determines where they can be accessed in the code.
* There are two types of scopes: global and local.
* Global variables are defined outside of functions and can be accessed from anywhere in the code.
* Local variables are defined within a function and can only be accessed within that function.
* When a variable is accessed, Python uses the LEGB rule to determine the scope in which the variable is defined: Local, Enclosed, Global and Built-in.
* The LEGB rule checks for the variable in the following order: Local, Enclosed, Global, Built-in.
* The first place where the variable is found is where it is used.
* If a variable is defined in multiple scopes, the innermost scope takes precedence over the outer scopes.
