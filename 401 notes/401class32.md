## Things I want to know more about

* Django Rest Framework provides built-in permissions for controlling access to views.
* Permissions can be set globally or per-view.
* There are several built-in permission classes, such as IsAuthenticated, AllowAny, and IsAdminUser.
* Custom permission classes can be created by subclassing BasePermission.
* Permission classes can control access to views by denying or allowing requests based on the user's authentication status and other attributes.
* Permissions can also be combined using permission classes such as IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly.
* The permission class can be set in the permission_classes attribute of the view or viewset.
* The DRF documentation provides detailed examples and explanations of using and customizing permissions.
