## Things I want to know more about

* Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers.
* Containers allow you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a single unit that can be run anywhere.
* Docker provides a platform for developers to build and run their applications in a consistent environment, regardless of the host operating system.
* The Docker platform is made up of the Docker Engine, a lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and the Docker Hub, a cloud-based registry for sharing and storing Docker images.
* Docker images are the building blocks of a Docker application and contain everything needed to run the application, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.
* Docker containers are created from Docker images and run in isolated environments, allowing multiple containers to run on the same host without interfering with each other.
* Docker provides a simple and efficient way to deploy and manage applications, making it easier to scale and improve the reliability of your application.
* The Docker ecosystem offers a rich set of tools and services, including orchestration tools like Docker Compose and Kubernetes, to help you manage your Docker applications.
