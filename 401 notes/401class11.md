## Things I want to know more about

* Numpy is a Python library for working with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices of numerical data.
* It provides a high-performance, multi-dimensional array object, and a set of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
* Numpy is particularly useful for numerical computations, such as scientific and engineering applications, and data analysis.
* It allows for the manipulation of large arrays of homogeneous data, such as numerical values or dates, in a way that is more efficient than using Python's built-in data structures.
* It also provides features such as broadcasting, which allows for the efficient manipulation of arrays of different shapes, and vectorization, which allows for the application of mathematical operations to entire arrays at once.
