## Things I want to know more about

## Python Dunder Methods

* Dunder methods, also known as "magic methods," are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores.
* Dunder methods can be used to define how objects of a class behave when used with built-in Python functions or operators, such as +, -, *, and /.
* Some examples of commonly used dunder methods include init for object initialization, repr for object representation, and eq for equality testing.
* By implementing dunder methods in your own classes, you can make your code more intuitive and expressive, and take advantage of Python's built-in functionality.
* Dunder methods are powerful tools, but should be used judiciously to avoid making your code unnecessarily complex or difficult to read.

## Python Iterators

* An iterator is an object that allows you to traverse through a sequence of values one at a time, without needing to store the entire sequence in memory.
* In Python, iterators are implemented using the iter and next dunder methods.
* Examples of built-in Python iterators include lists, tuples, and dictionaries, which can all be iterated through using a for loop.
* You can create your own custom iterators in Python by defining a class with an iter method that returns an object with a next method.
* Iterators are an important concept in Python, and are used extensively in functional programming, generators, and other advanced Python features.

## Python Generators

* A generator is a special type of iterator that allows you to define a sequence of values on the fly, without needing to create the entire sequence in memory first.
* In Python, generators are implemented using the yield keyword, which allows you to "pause" the generator and return a value, before resuming execution where you left off.
* Generators can be used to generate infinite sequences of values, or to generate values on the fly based on some input data or algorithm.
* Generators are memory-efficient, since they only generate values as needed, rather than storing the entire sequence in memory.
* Generators are a powerful tool in Python, and are used extensively in functional programming, data processing, and other advanced Python features.

## Python Decorators

* A decorator is a function that takes another function as input, and returns a new function that adds some extra functionality to the original function.
* Decorators can be used to modify the behavior of existing functions without needing to modify their source code, or to add additional functionality to new functions.
* In Python, decorators are implemented using the @ symbol, which is placed above the function definition and followed by the decorator function.
* There are many built-in decorators in Python, such as @staticmethod and @classmethod, which modify the behavior of methods in a class.
* You can also create your own custom decorators in Python, which can be used to add functionality such as logging, timing, or input validation to your functions.

# Readings: Ethics

1. "Our approach to AI" by Microsoft
  
* Microsoft is committed to responsible AI development, with a focus on developing AI that enhances human capabilities and addresses societal challenges.
* The company has established six principles to guide their AI development: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability.
* To ensure that their AI products and services align with these principles, Microsoft has established an AI Ethics Board, which provides oversight and guidance to the company's AI work.
* Microsoft also invests in AI research, partnerships, and initiatives to help advance the field and promote responsible development.
* The company is also focused on ensuring that AI benefits everyone, regardless of their location, background, or abilities.
* Microsoft believes that responsible AI development can help address some of the world's biggest challenges, such as climate change, healthcare, and education.
* Ultimately, Microsoft aims to use AI to empower people and organizations to achieve more and create a better future for all.

1. "Will Democracy Survive Big Data and Artificial Intelligence?" by Scientific American

* The article argues that the rise of big data and AI could pose a threat to democracy, as they have the potential to be used to manipulate public opinion and infringe on individuals' privacy.
* The ability to collect and analyze vast amounts of data allows for the creation of targeted and personalized messages that can influence people's beliefs and behaviors.
* In addition, AI-powered systems can be used to create deepfakes and other forms of misinformation that are difficult to detect and combat.
* The article suggests that these risks can be mitigated through increased transparency and accountability in the use of data and AI.
* This includes measures such as clear labeling of political ads and increased regulation of social media platforms.
* The article also emphasizes the importance of educating individuals on how to identify and combat misinformation.
* The article argues that it is up to society to ensure that the benefits of big data and AI are balanced against the potential risks to democracy.

3. "Hundreds of Microsoft employees protest the company's work with ICE and demand it stop selling technology to the military" by Business Insider

* Hundreds of Microsoft employees signed an open letter to CEO Satya Nadella and President Brad Smith, calling on the company to cancel its contracts with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and stop developing technology for the military.
* The letter cites concerns about the use of Microsoft's technology for "violating human rights and empowering those who would abuse them."
* The employees argue that Microsoft should not be "in the business of war" and that the company should prioritize ethical considerations in its business decisions.
* In response to the letter, Microsoft defended its work with ICE and the military, arguing that their technology is used for lawful purposes and that they are committed to ethical development and use of technology.
* The company also emphasized the importance of engaging in constructive dialogue with employees and stakeholders on these issues.
* The protest reflects growing concerns among tech workers about the ethical implications of their work and their companies' relationships with government agencies.
* The incident highlights the need for companies to consider the ethical implications of their technology and engage in transparent dialogue with their employees and stakeholders.
