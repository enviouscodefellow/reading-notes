## Things I want to know more about

# Python Dunder Methods:

* Dunder methods, also known as "magic methods," are special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores.
* Dunder methods can be used to define how objects of a class behave when used with built-in Python functions or operators, such as +, -, *, and /.
* Some examples of commonly used dunder methods include init for object initialization, repr for object representation, and eq for equality testing.
* By implementing dunder methods in your own classes, you can make your code more intuitive and expressive, and take advantage of Python's built-in functionality.
* Dunder methods are powerful tools, but should be used judiciously to avoid making your code unnecessarily complex or difficult to read.

# Python Iterators:

* An iterator is an object that allows you to traverse through a sequence of values one at a time, without needing to store the entire sequence in memory.
* In Python, iterators are implemented using the iter and next dunder methods.
* Examples of built-in Python iterators include lists, tuples, and dictionaries, which can all be iterated through using a for loop.
* You can create your own custom iterators in Python by defining a class with an iter method that returns an object with a next method.
* Iterators are an important concept in Python, and are used extensively in functional programming, generators, and other advanced Python features.

# Python Generators:

* A generator is a special type of iterator that allows you to define a sequence of values on the fly, without needing to create the entire sequence in memory first.
* In Python, generators are implemented using the yield keyword, which allows you to "pause" the generator and return a value, before resuming execution where you left off.
* Generators can be used to generate infinite sequences of values, or to generate values on the fly based on some input data or algorithm.
* Generators are memory-efficient, since they only generate values as needed, rather than storing the entire sequence in memory.
* Generators are a powerful tool in Python, and are used extensively in functional programming, data processing, and other advanced Python features.

# A Primer on Python Decorators:

* A decorator is a function that takes another function as input, and returns a new function that adds some extra functionality to the original function.
* Decorators can be used to modify the behavior of existing functions without needing to modify their source code, or to add additional functionality to new functions.
* In Python, decorators are implemented using the @ symbol, which is placed above the function definition and followed by the decorator function.
* There are many built-in decorators in Python, such as @staticmethod and @classmethod, which modify the behavior of methods in a class.
* You can also create your own custom decorators in Python, which can be used to add functionality such as logging, timing, or input validation to your functions.
