[CSS Transitions & Animations](http://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)

#### What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?
* With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

* Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

#### How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?
* As mentioned, for a transition to take place, an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.
